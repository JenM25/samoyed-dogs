# The Samoyed Dog Breed 
An ultimate guide about samoyed dogs.
  
## 1.) Fluffy, White Fur!
  
 Samoyeds are infamous for having white fur that makes them look like tiny polar bear dogs. Since they come from Siberia, their fur helps them blend into the white snow in their environment. However, samoyed dogs that live in places like California where temperatures are hot have adapted to the different conditions.

### 2.) A Playful Personality
Samoyeds are super friendly dogs that love being around people and chasing things. They can be energetic and lively when playing with their owner. They are very clever, as well. Samoyed dogs even help pull sleds through the snow in parts of the world.
